# :hourglass_flowing_sand: Elevator Operation
This assignment requires an elevator operation to be simulated in Verilog. There are 4 floors between which the elevator can move and there are buttons on each floor, all external to the elevator. A button press implies certain action to be taken, which are described in detail in the following sections. The elevator system can be modeled as a Finite State Machine that undergo state transitions and produces outputs depending on the inputs provided. Design the Finite state machine and describe its behavior either by using a state diagram or a table. Implement the system according to the specifications mentioned below, in Verilog and submit the code as well as the waveforms along with a detailed write up describing the same.
